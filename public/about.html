    <h1>MiniNEC JS</h1>
    <p>MiniNEC JS is a free antenna modelling program for the browser. It is a JavaScript/WebAssembly port of MiniNEC.</p>
    <p>The calculation engine is based on a MiniNEC release labelled "MiniNEC3, NOSC code 822, JCL change 9", dated 26 Nov 1986.
      It has been ported to C++ and is compiled to WebAssembly using <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>.
      The UI is written in TypeScript and uses the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> framework for reactivity and
      <a href="https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/">Primitive UI</a> for layout.
    </p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>MiniNEC was written by John Rockway and James Logan of the Naval Operations Sea Centre, San Diego, US in the early eighties. In contrast with NEC2, MiniNEC was 
      written in BASIC and ran on home computers. The first public release was in 1982, and it was one of earliest antenna modelling programs accessible to hobbyists.</p>
    <p>In later years NEC2 and its derivatives grew more popular. NEC2 is a heavier code, written in FORTRAN, with a more advanced grounding model. 
      EZNec and 4NEC2, modern ports of NEC2 with more user friendly interfaces, made NEC2 the most popular choice for antenna modelling.</p>
    <p>MiniNEC is still a very competent code and for some antenna modelling problems, e.g. antennas with tapered wires, the better choice.
      The code is also surprisingly small: only 1600 lines of BASIC. But the original user interface feels now very outdated, and BASIC interpreters are no longer
      by default installed on computers, making it complicated to run MiniNEC.</p>

    <h1>Differences</h1>
    <p>MiniNEC JS uses the same algorithms as MiniNEC, and gives in most cases very similar results. Here's a list of known differences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All calculations are in IEEE754 double precision. MiniNEC uses single precision in the floating format of the BASIC environment.
          Many BASIC environments use non-standard formats with worse accuracy than IEEE754.</li>
        <li>S-domain loads work correctly. MiniNEC contains a scaling bug causing incorrect results for S-domain loads.</li>
        <li>The limit on the number of wires and pulses have been increased to 500.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Missing features</h1>
    <p>Some features are not implemented yet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Far field in absolute values (V/m)</li>
        <li>Far field with multiple ground types, heights or ground conductors</li>
        <li>Near field</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The source code of the UI is available on <a href="https://github.com/renaatd/mininecjs">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>The source code of the calculation engine needs some love and care, and isn't yet available.</p>
